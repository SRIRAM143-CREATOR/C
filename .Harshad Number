A Harshad Number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.
int main() {
   int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int r=n;
    int sum=0;
    while(r!=0){
        sum=sum+r%10;
        r=r/10;
        
    }
    if(n%sum==0){
        printf("%d is a harshad number",n);
    }
    else{
         printf("%d is not a harshad number",n);
       
       
    }
    

}
